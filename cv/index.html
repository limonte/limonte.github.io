        <h1>Limon Monte</h1>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 18 years of experience and comfortable working across the entire web stack
          including front-end, back-end (Node.js and PHP), and DevOps/DevSecOps.
        </p>
        <p>I work primarily with TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and related technologies.</p>
        <p>I'm also very comfortable and up-to-date with PHP and Laravel.</p>
